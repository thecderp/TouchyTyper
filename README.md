# TouchyTyper

---
### This is a program where it generates random numbers, and prints out a random string. You then type what it says on the console without looking at the keyboard.
### This can teach you where the keys go, and will increase your accuarcy. Thanks to pendevx for showing me this touch typing technique. This program will help me, because i'll use it.
A program I'm making to just learn how to touch type, because I'm a derpy boi.
